I am Khudoyberdi from Uzbekistan, and I do backend development. I am crazy about learning languages and technologies needed to build massive applications. I also enjoy mentoring because I feel the need to teach someone else to be a problem solver when I was taught for a long time by so many nice engineers.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JavaScript / TypeScript / NodeJS / MongoDB / Git /
