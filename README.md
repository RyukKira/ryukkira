### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Khudoyberdi from Uzbekistan, and I do backend development. I am crazy about learning languages and technologies needed to build massive applications. I also enjoy mentoring because I feel the need to teach someone else to be a problem solver when I was taught for a long time by so many nice engineers. Reach out to me: t.me/fasabrunjameel
